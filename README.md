## 🛠️ Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/perlimpinpin.git
cd perlimpinpin
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=Your-API-KEY" > .env

# Start the project with Docker
docker-compose up --build
```

This project is containerized using docker. In order to run it, you have to install [docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).  
Do not forget to add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` beforehand. You can get a free one on [Google AI studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).  

Once the server is up, you can access it locally via [your browser on http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80).  

When you're done, you can delete all containers and images with `sudo docker system prune`. Be careful if you have other containers that are running, you should rather delete it manually.
